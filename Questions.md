1.	What is the DOM?
        •	DOM stands for “Document Object Model”. It represents the content of a webpage that can be manipulated with the use of JavaScript. It acts as a bridge between code and the browser and is an API (Application Programming Interface) that is provided by the browser itself, not JavaScript. 

2.	What is an event?
        •	Events notify code when something interesting has occurred. Events are represented by objects that are based on the Event interface, and they may use additional customized fields and/or functions to gather additional information about what has occurred.

3.	What is an event listener?
        •	Event listeners are methods that set up the function that will be called when a specified event is sent to the target such as Document, Element, or Window.

4.	Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
        •	Because NodeList objects look like arrays but they are actually prototypes that cannot be used with array methods such as forEach or map.

5.	What is a component?
        •	Components are sections of code that can be used in DRY code to make development faster and easier. They simplify the code to make it more helpful when it comes to debugging and reusability.
